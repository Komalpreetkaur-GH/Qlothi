# Qlothi: AI-Powered Fashion Hub for Pinterest

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup (Windows/Linux/macOS)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```powershell
   playwright install chromium
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
   *The server will run at `http://localhost:8000`.*

## 🌐 Deployment

### Part 1: FastAPI Backend (Hugging Face Spaces, Render, or Railway)
Because the backend uses a heavy AI classification model (`Segformer`), it requires a cloud host with at least **2GB to 4GB of RAM**:
1. Add a `Dockerfile` and push your `backend` directory to a GitHub repository.
2. Link your GitHub repository to a cloud service like Render or Hugging Face.
3. Configure the start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. Once successfully deployed, copy your new live URL (e.g., `https://qlothi-api.onrender.com`).

### Part 2: Publish the Chrome Extension
1. Open your extension's JavaScript files (`background.js`, `content.js`) and replace any instances of `http://localhost:8000` with your new live backend URL.
2. Zip the entire `/extension` folder (make sure `manifest.json` is at the root of the zip file, and not buried in a subfolder).
3. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/).
4. Click **New Item**, upload the Zip, fill out your store listing details, and click **Submit for Review**.
